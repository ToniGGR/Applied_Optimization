<strong>
  Usaging the Main.py
</strong>

<strong> 1 </strong> By Handing over your trial you can provide your own value for the cyclone and test the restults 
<br>
<strong> 2 </strong> Starting the algorithms and see the optimization 
<br>
<strong> 3 </strong> There you can create the charts to compare the algorithms
